This is a normal paragraph. I can make some letters **bold** or even *italic*. Here is a [link back home](/).

## Some stuff

It is possible to also include `code` and code blocks:

```
// comment
function myFunction(test) {
  test += 1;
  return test;
}

let myVariable = myFunction(1);
```

Do you want to see a table?

| Hello | World | Hello |
| -- | -- | -- |
| One | Two | Three |
| First | Second | Third |
| One | Two | Three |
